# HouseLoan
This Repo contains my analysis and inference on the house loans dataset [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishikeshkonapure/home-loan-approval). I use MySQL file to gain insights from the dataaset such as the relation between gender and home loan approval status. The SQL file is provided for reference along with all the queries executed and their explanations. 

The dataset is then loaded to colab and standard machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, SVC and RandomForest are used to predict the loan status given all the other features.
